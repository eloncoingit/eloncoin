=====================================

What is Eloncoin?
----------------

Eloncoin is heavily based on Litecoin - but with 100% more Elon:

- New Genisis block with Elon.
- There are now Eloncoin, elons and els
- Only ~4500 Blocks are found - so you can still mine with a CPU! (Since nobody can buy a GPU currently anyway...)
  - Litecoin has currently more than 2&nbsp;000&nbsp;000 blocks

But WHY?

You son of a bitch - I'm in. Where can I get it?
----------------

You can find binaries for Windows 64 bit and Linux/Ubuntu 20.04 in [**releases**](https://github.com/eloncoingit/eloncoin/releases).

You will probably need to install some libraries for Ubuntu:

```
sudo apt-get install libboost-filesystem1.71.0 libboost-thread1.71.0 libboost-chrono1.71.0 libevent-pthreads-2.1-7 
```

### Bahahahah, I'm not trusting some binary on the internet.

We hear you!

All build instructions can be found [here](https://github.com/eloncoingit/eloncoin/tree/master/doc) or:
- [windows](https://github.com/eloncoingit/eloncoin/blob/master/doc/build-windows.md)
- [unix](https://github.com/eloncoingit/eloncoin/blob/master/doc/build-unix.md)
- [osx](https://github.com/eloncoingit/eloncoin/blob/master/doc/build-osx.md)

_______________________

How do I start?
----------------

- Make sure port tcp 1971 is reachable from outside (optinal, but highly recommended)
- Open the eloncoin-qt(.exe) or eloncoind(.exe)

Congratulations You're done!

### But I want to mine my very own eloncoins!

Currently there is no Eloncoin mining pool, so we only have solo mining.

_______________________

What is left todo?
----------------

- spread the word
- create mining pools
- mine coins
- get Eloncoin listed on an exchange (binance etc.)
- profit

## Disclamer

Eloncoin relies heavily on the work of the [Litecoin](https://litecoin.org/) and [Bitcoin](https://bitcoin.org) project.
